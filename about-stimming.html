            <h2>What is Stimming? 🌟</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Stimming</strong> (short for self-stimulating behavior) is when you do repetitive movements, 
                sounds, or actions that help you feel good, calm, or focused. Everyone stims in their own way!
            </p>

            <h3>Why Do People Stim?</h3>

            <h3>Is Stimming Okay? ✅</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Yes! Absolutely!</strong> Stimming is a normal and natural thing that everyone does.

                and that's perfectly fine. What matters is that it helps you!

            <h3>Different People, Different Stims 🌈</h3>

                Autistic people often stim more noticeably or frequently, but <strong>everyone stims</strong> 
                in some way. You might bite your nails, twirl your hair, tap your foot, or chew gum. 
                These are all types of stimming!
            </p>
